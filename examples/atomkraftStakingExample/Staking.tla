------------------------- MODULE Staking ---------------------------------
(*
 * Modeling delegate and unbond in the staking module.
 * This is a very minimal spec to reproduce a reported issue.
 *
 * Simplifications:
 *   - We keep track of the gas token only (e.g., stake in cosmos-sdk).
 *   - We assume only one validator to be delegated to.
 *   - Rewards are not specified.

VARIABLES    
    \* The last executed transaction.
